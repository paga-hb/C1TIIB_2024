    "\n",
    "BDD end-to-end testing with xUnit, FluentAssertions and Playwright, is basically the same as the end-to-end testing with xUnit, FluentAssertions and Playwright we investigated in the previous notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's new in BDD end-to-end testing is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The development approach referred to as [Behavior Driven Development (BDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development).\n",
    "- The additional testing tool [SpecFlow](https://specflow.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Behavior Driven Development (BDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Involves:\n",
    "  - Naming software tests using a domain specific language (DSL) to describe the behavior of the code.\n",
    "  - Using natural-language constructs (e.g., English-like sentences) that can express behaviors and the expected outcomes.\n",
    "  - The use of specialized tools, e.g. [SpecFlow](https://specflow.org).\n",
    "- Encourages:\n",
    "  - Collaboration among developers, quality assurance experts, and customer representatives in a software project.\n",
    "  - Teams to use conversation and concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the application should behave.\n",
    "- Is considered:\n",
    "  - An effective practice especially when the problem space is complex.\n",
    "  - A refinement of test-driven development (TDD).\n",
    "  - An idea about how software development should be managed by both business interests and technical insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "[SpecFlow](https://specflow.org)\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Is specialized BDD tool developed for .NET.\n",
    "- Uses the [Gherkin](https://specflow.org/learn/gherkin) syntax as its domain specific language (DSL). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Gherkin](https://specflow.org/learn/gherkin) language consists of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Feature`: Describes the overall functionality or feature being tested, i.e. a high-level context for what the tests aim to validate, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  Feature: User Login\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `User Story`: A brief description (user story) of how I user intends to use the feature, in the `As a, I want, So that` format, e.g.:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  Feature: User Login\n",
    "    As a user,\n",
    "    I want to log into the application,\n",
    "    So that I can access personalized features.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `User Scenario`: A specific example or situation within the feature that is being tested (a single test case with a specific input and expected outcome), e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  Feature: User Login\n",
    "    As a user,\n",
    "    I want to log into the application,\n",
    "    So that I can access personalized features.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Scenario is expressed in the `Given, When, Then` format (you can compare it to `Arrage`, `Act`, `Assert`), e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  Feature: User Login\n",
    "    As a user,\n",
    "    I want to log into the application,\n",
    "    So that I can access personalized features.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials\n",
    "      Given: the user is on the login page\n",
    "      When: the user enters valid credentials and clicks the login button\n",
    "      Then: the user should be redirected to the dashboard\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "There can be multiple Scenarios for each Feature, and there are additional constructs that can be added to a Scenario, but `Given, When, Then` is the most basic.\n",
    "\n",
    "`SpecFlow` supports BDD by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Defining a Feature with its various Scenarios in a `Feature File` with the file extension `.feature`.\n",
    "- Mapping the `Given, When, Then` steps of a Scenario to a `Steps File`, which is a Class file with extension `.cs`, in which:\n",
    "  - The class must be adorned with the `[Binding]` attribute (so that SpecFlow can find/identify the `Steps File`s),\n",
    "  - Each of the `Given`, `When` and `Then` sections in the `Feature File` are mapped to a method each in the `Steps File`.\n",
    "- A steps file is actually a `xUnit` file, in disguise, with a Tes` Class and Test Methods.\n",
    "- Permitting the definition of a Test Fixture (called a `Driver` in `SpecFlow`).\n",
    "- Permitting the definition of a `Hook` file, that determines what code, if any, is run before and after each scenario.\n",
    "- Permitting the definition of a `Page` files, that collects `Playwright` command for each page in one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how we can put all this together to end-to-end test creating a new TodoItem in our application.\n",
